{{< typeit tag=h3 >}} Hey there! {{< /typeit >}}

I was born in :ukraine: Ukraine and have been living in :de: Germany since 2008.
I earned a Master of Science in Chemistry from Goethe University Frankfurt,
where I specialized in chemoinformatics for my master’s thesis.

In recent years, my work has focused on predictive maintenance, where I develop
robust machine learning solutions to enhance system performance and reliability.
I have extensive expertise in machine learning and data-driven problem-solving,
with a strong track record of delivering impactful projects.

Beyond my work, I am passionate about community engagement and knowledge
sharing. Supporting others and exchanging ideas is an integral part of who I am,
both professionally and personally.

Currently, I reside in
[Wächtersbach](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Wächtersbach,Germany), a charming
town near [Frankfurt am Main](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Fankfurt,Germany).
I stay active with :roller_skate: inline skating, :basketball: basketball, and
:muscle: fitness, and I enjoy experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen
:man_cook:.
