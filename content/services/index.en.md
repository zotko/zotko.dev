## Consulting

I bring my scientific background and technical expertise to help your
organization harness the power of data science. Having built successful systems
from scratch, I know how to navigate technical challenges while delivering
business value.

How I can help:

- I'll review your data processes and identify practical optimization
  opportunities
- Together, we'll develop custom solutions that solve your data challenges
- I'll help create a realistic roadmap for your data and ML initiatives
- I'll provide technical architecture insights and implementation guidance

## Workshops

My workshops are not theoretical lectures â€“ they're hands-on sessions where we
tackle your real-world challenges. I bring my experience from building
production systems and apply these insights directly to the problems you're
facing today. Each workshop is designed to help you overcome your specific
technical obstacles with proven, practical solutions.

What you'll learn:

- Solid fundamentals of Python programming and development
- Techniques for transforming messy data into valuable insights
- Feature engineering and ML model optimization
- Problem-solving approaches from real industry cases
- Principles of writing clean and maintainable code
- Leveraging AI tools to enhance your development process

## Mentorship

Having successfully transitioned from chemistry to data science, I deeply
understand the challenges of breaking into tech without a traditional CS
background. I've walked this path myself and know exactly what it takes to
succeed. My mentorship program provides structured guidance that I wish I had
when I started my journey.

What makes my mentorship unique:

- 17,000+ Stack Overflow reputation and Python Gold Badge
- Battle-tested strategies from my successful transition into the German tech
- Hands-on support with real projects, using my production experience
- Practical insights into German tech culture and industry expectations
- Personalized roadmap for courses and certifications to advance your skills
- Interview preparation and resume crafting
