<!-- ## What My Clients Say

![feedback](img.png)

> Mykola immediately understood the requirements for this contract and was able
> to produce a proof of concept solution in only 2 hours (prior to posting this
> contract, a junior data scientist had spent almost 2 weeks to get the same
> result). His grasp on the short and long term requirements of the larger
> project that this contract is attached to were perfect and he has already
> given us ideas for future enhancements to the application using machine
> learning. Furthermore, his comprehension of statistics and his ability to
> apply modern tools, libraries and programming to completing this initial
> contract is at well above the industry standard. As both a programmer and
> project manager, I can personally state that his code was well written,
> included comments and was trivial to adapt to our existing codebase. We will
> absolutely continue using Mykola's services for all future development on the
> larger application and I can happily recommend him to anyone looking for help
> on any system that requires a talented data scientist. -->
